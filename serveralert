<p>Welcome to another Hour of Twilight alpha test. This is still a very early stage test, so please keep in mind that some things will be broken or unbalanced. Please report any constructive feedback through our <a href="https://discord.gg/Sag44ar">Discord</a>.<br/><br/></p>
<p>The Adventurer class is now the only playable class.<br/><br/></p>
<p>The Pirate Seas dungeon has been removed. It was a fun idea but in reality transports are too buggy.<br/><br/></p>
<p>All information on the server can be accessed through our <a href="https://discord.gg/Sag44ar">Discord</a>.<br/><br/></p>
<p>Have fun.</p>
