<h1 align="left">16th March 2022</h1>
<p>The new open alpha is available to play from the 16th March 2022. It will stay open for about 2 weeks.<br/><br/></p>
<p>This has been long overdue and will be nearly an entire year since we hosted the last public alpha. We are excited for you to try out the new content and other changes.<br/><br/></p>
<p>We do still consider ourselves to be in an alpha stage which means that you can expect there to be some problems with issues that we fail to catch internally, and we have not turned our focus towards balance yet. The Wednesday release date should give us time to spot and fix any major issues quickly before the weekend, which is when we anticipate most people playing.<br/><br/></p>
<p>Existing characters from previous alphas have been locked temporarily, but will be available to play again later in the alpha.<br/><br/></p>
<p>We hope you enjoy the project. Thank you for taking part in our alpha test.<br/><br/></p>
